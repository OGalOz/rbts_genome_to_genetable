# rbts_genome_to_genetable


If using this app as a local function, specifically the function 
'genome_to_genetable', then the function takes as an input a dict with 
the key 'genome_ref' and creates the table at the location
'g2gt_results/genes.GC' within your working directory (workdir).
More info can be found under the spec file 'rbts_genome_to_genetable.spec'
in the main directory of the repository.
Note that if the genome fna file has scaffold names with spaces in them,
it only takes the first part of the space, unless it is explicitly stated
not to.



If running from the narrative, this app is designed to take a Genome Object in KBase and convert it 
into a Gene Table (genes.GC) as used by the RBTnSeq apps. It creates
the data type KBaseRBTnSeq.RBTS_InputGenesTable



This is a [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).

You will need to have the SDK installed to use this module. [Learn more about the SDK and how to use it](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/).

You can also learn more about the apps implemented in this module from its [catalog page](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/rbts_genome_to_genetable) or its [spec file]($module_name.spec).

# Setup and test

Add your KBase developer token to `test_local/test.cfg` and run the following:

```bash
$ make
$ kb-sdk test
```

After making any additional changes to this repo, run `kb-sdk test` again to verify that everything still works.

# Installation from another module

To use this code in another SDK module, call `kb-sdk install rbts_genome_to_genetable` in the other module's root directory.
